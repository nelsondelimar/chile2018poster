# Chile 2018 - Poster


**This repository was created to keep saved the poster that will be presented on [Chilean Geological Congress](http://congresogeologicochileno.cl/en/home/).**


**The work consists in apply gravity crustal modeling in order to finding the single residual anomaly of Barreirinhas basin (Maranh√£o, Northeast, Brazil). We compare some former techniques of regional-residual separation, such as Robust Polynomial Fitting and Spectral Analysis. Our results were satisfactory. Furthermore it is more than recommendable that this new approach should be use from now on!.**
